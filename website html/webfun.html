    <h1> Mitigating Corporate information Exposure on the web </h1>
    <h2> Introduction: </h2>
    <p> The world wide web is a very power tool utilised by the majority of the world in particular that of the western world. This has led to a vast increase of information being immediately accessible that the ethics and the safety of how what why this data is used and processed. In this article I am aiming to explain the methods, protocols and strategies that companies can employ to try and deal with Corporate information exposure specifically related to the web.</p>
    <h2> Corporate information exposure: </h2>
    <h3> what is it? </h3>
    <p> The way it is best way to start this is with a simple definition. “An information exposure is the intentional or unintentional disclosure of information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.”i Essential it is where information that has been gathered for any sort of use is leaked to/obtained by people who should not have access to it. This could be any kind of data from a person’s address to their phone number or even their medical or bank details. The most common ways in which corporate information exposure comes about is due to cyber-attacks and that data being stolen then uploaded to public websites </p>
    <h3> why is it important? </h3>
    <p>Corporate information exposure is an important topic to consider for each companies in the modern world regardless of what kind of business it is. This is partially due to legal and financial constraints that have been produced with acts and codes of conduct created to protect individuals from being put in danger; these also hold companies liable and accountable for illegal/fraudulent activity. Another reason companies should consider corporate information with a high importance is that is that a neglect for it can cause a lack of trust in your company and a lack of investment which can grind your company to a holt. “…it is important to persons who act on behalf of the company because it enables them to take decisions on a rational basis … investors and other stakeholders also need to make decisions on a rational basis for example, the disclosure”ii essentially if information is put at risk the any company(s) can be at equal risk.</p>
    <h2> Methods of dealing with corporate information exposure (technologically): </h2>
    <p>As i have stated a lot of Corporate information is collected for business or other uses and if this information is leaked then we get corporate information exposure the most common form as i have said is where information is stolen through cyber-attacks. Therefore to mitigate Corporate information exposure in particularly on the net it is necessary to adequate cyber security and technologies in place for your business as a fail-safe and for general protection. To quote the NCSC (national computer security center), “any information which is published for open consumption should be systematically filtered before it is released to ensure anything of value to an attacker… is removed”.</p>
    <p>The CPNI (the centre for the protection of national infrastructure) also have helpful guidelines that business’s should be implementing and keeping up with as much as possible. Some of these most helpful for mitigating information exposure on the web are: “boundary firewalls and internet gateways: establish network perimeter defences, particularly web proxy, web filtering, content checking, and firewall policies to detect and block executable downloads, block access to known malicious domains and prevent users’ computers from communicating directly with the Internet malware protection: establish and maintain malware defences to detect and respond to known attack code patch management: patch known vulnerabilities with the latest version of the software, to prevent attacks which exploit software bugs” iii. By implementing these things companies can keep most of the data they collect safe this way the data from hackers and this go some way towards mitigating information exposure.</p>
    <h2> Methods of dealing with corporate information exposure (sociologically): </h2>
    <p>Whilst it is necessary to have technological methods in place for dealing with the possibility of corporate information exposure it is also necessary to take into consideration the social elements and company policy can also have a huge impact and risk on how you mitigate corporate information exposure for example identity fraud and or a lack of care/or deliberate malice intent in how individuals themselves deal with the information which is a surprisingly big problem that has to always be addressed. Often it is IT staff themselves that brake or disobey rules regarding safety due to their confidence in the field. </p>
    <p>As a result of this companies will often also utilise policies that are made clear to employees individual and as a whole the CPNI recommends “password policy…user access control…whitelisting and execution control…user training and education awareness”iv. These are all types of procedures/protocol policies you can put into place that reduce the chances of human errors that led to issues of data being lost. </p>
    <p>Password Policy: is a set of protocols that a company puts forward to that sets minimum guidelines on how employees and individuals (customers and stakeholders too) go about the passwords and security questions for example employees might be advised constantly not to use relatable things as passwords or to use different styles of characters such as symbols and numbers where possible.</p>
    <p>User Training; Education and awareness: to quote the CPNI “All your users should understand how published information about your systems and operation can reveal potential vulnerabilities. They need to be aware of the risks of discussing work-related topics on social media, and the potential for them to be targeted by phishing attacks. They should also understand the risks to the business of releasing sensitive information in general conversations, unsolicited telephone calls and email recipients.” v </p>
    <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
    <p>In overall conclusion Corporate information exposure especially on the web is a very concerning issue and how companies handle our data is vitally important for people within western society as a whole, despite our great and vast technological advancements of late however the security and counter exposure measure have yet to really catch-up with information and data uses’ and access however over time this is starting to change especially from a social engineering prospective.</p>
